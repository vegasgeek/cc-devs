Adds the ability to easily CC developers on all admin emails

== Description ==

Have you ever built a site for a client and your email address gets set as the admin email, then lost access to the site but continue to receive their admin emails until the end of time? Me, too!

The CC Devs plugin adds a field to the General settings page where you can add a comma separated list of emails who should receive copies of admin emails for testing. The dev's version of the emails will include a link allowing them to unsubscribe from the site's emails.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `ccdevs` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

or
1. Go to `Plugins` -> `Add New` and search for CC Devs
