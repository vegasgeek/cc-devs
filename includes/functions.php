 * Items that need to be built:
 * 1. Add field to general settings page to allow for comma separated list of email address
 * 2. If emails exist in field, add them to CC field for any emails going to admin
 * 3. Store a transient token for 3 days to allow for CC'd person to be allowed to alter that field, even if not logged in
 * 4. Append a link to emails that would allow a dev to click and unsubscribe from the list
 * - - The link should include the token. If the token matches a transient, we remove the dev from the CC field
